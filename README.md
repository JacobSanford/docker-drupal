# Branch Deprecated
Oh no!

## Notice
Use of this branch (_alpine-nginx-php7-8.x_) and docker image (_unblibraries/drupal:alpine-nginx-php7-8.x_) is deprecated. Development has halted, and updates will not continue. At the time of deprecation, this branch was functional - but may be unstable.

## Background
Organic development led to this image being previously available in numerous configurations and formats, which became a tremendous maintenance burden. As of June 1 2017, there is currently only one supported branch - [unblibraries/drupal:alpine-nginx-php7-8.x](https://github.com/unb-libraries/docker-drupal/tree/alpine-nginx-php7-8.x). All other branches have been deprecated and will not be updated. They will most likely become broken!

## Actions to Take
Any references should be replaced ASAP with [unblibraries/drupal:alpine-nginx-php7-8.x-composer](https://github.com/unb-libraries/docker-drupal/tree/alpine-nginx-php7-8.x-composer), or [the Official Drupal docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal/). In either case, reconfiguration of your dependent image will be necessary.

If you wish to contribute to revive this branch or maintain these other configurations, please contact the maintainers at libsystems@unb.ca.

## Deprecation Date
This branch **will be deleted and the image removed from DockerHub on June 1, 2017**.

## Contact Information
If you have any questions, or critiques, please contact the maintainers at libsystems@unb.ca.
